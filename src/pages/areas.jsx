          CONRADâ€™s accomplishments expose the pressing need to continue
          conducting innovative research and development. Our products are
          designed primarily for women in low-resource settings, and thus a
          large emphasis is put on safety, effectiveness, affordability, and
          acceptability/user-friendliness. Innovation and user-centered designs
          are our hallmark.
